## Description

ROMS-Darwin is an implementation of the [Darwin ecosystem model](http://darwinproject.mit.edu/) in the Regional Ocean Modeling System ([ROMS](https://www.myroms.org/)).
It permits running Darwin in a regional configuration.

## Documentation

As of now, there is no official documentation available for ROMS-Darwin in this repository, and we will attempt to add documentation on demand. If there are specific aspects or components you would like to see documented, please raise an issue, and we will prioritize its addition.

## Work in progress / features not yet implemented

Not all features of the original Darwin code are fully implemented (yet), among them are:
* A spectral light model as presented in Dutkiewicz *et al.* (2015).
* Proper handling of sedimentary iron sources.
